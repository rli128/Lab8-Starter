How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
    
    Graceful degradation is when we start with max technology and hopefully address lower levels with grace. Service workers allow operations to happen even when we are not connected to the internet by saving the data on your computer. Graceful degredation is the process of allowing our programs to maintain limited functionality even when our device has been made inoperative and service workers help us achieve this.
